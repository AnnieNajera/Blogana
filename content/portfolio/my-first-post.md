How I arrived at Making Devs?
============

I'm Ana and I'm 21 years old, months ago my friends and me dediced to do something else that just go to school. One day a guy invited us to go to Accenture to make an app. It just sounded like what we wanted to hear "do something else", finally the fist meeting arrived and I felt like ... It isn't gonna be easy and it wasn't! It's a long story and a great experience, I learnt a lot about myself and I descovered many kinds of emotions when you are working with a group of people for first time, actually I understood why is better don't match friends with "work", but we made up and now our relationship is far better. We won doing the best app of this generation, but more than it was the experience and the knowledge that we got and after that I'd known what looking for. This is exactly the moment when Making Devs arrived at my life, well almost the moment that I found them (remember this, I write 'them' not 'it'). I'm studying Informatic actually in the last year at the University, here in Mexico is common to do a social service as part of our graduate requirements, so when I wanted to start to do it, believe me I didn't find anywhere! Every place was the same, I didn't want this but in middle of this deception I finally saw the ligth at the end of the tunel, I contacted a friend of me and asked him the phone of the company, (it's important to say that he'd talked me about his job and it sounds interesting), after that I called and one week later was my interview, it's a little fuuny because a close friend of me also was her interview, it's was unexpected!
Since this first contact with Making Devs until now, I feel something that I can't call but it's freak! You notice all the stuffs that need learn or at least known, but you don't feel worry about it is more like a "plan" to follow!
The people around me is so awesome, I mean they know a lot about software but if they don't know something they asked for help and learn it! They also are people who dream bigest, the kind of people who enjoy every single minute.
